# Welcome

My name is Alex Hoffman. Welcome to my personal website! I'm a chemical engineer who is on the market for faculty positions. On this site, you can read [about me](about) or you can see a [list of my publications](publications). Please also feel free to [contact me](contact) by email or [follow me on twitter](www.twitter.com/ajhoffman1229), where I occasionally post things about my work.

Update (2023-11-04): this repository will be archived because I'm redesigning my website using a new template.

<!--I'm attending this year's AIChE conference, where I'll be giving three talks and a presenting a poster at the faculty candidate session. Here are the details:

1. "Computational assessment of catalytic materials" in the faculty candidate poster session&mdash;Poster 92, 1:00 to 3:00 PM Sunday, 13 Nov 2022 in North Hall E
2. "Origins of Changes in Methanol Dehydration Turnover Rates on Br&oslash;nsted Acid Sites in Zeolites with Different Al Distributions" in Fundamentals of Catalysis and Surface Science II: Zeolites and acid catalysis &mdash;12:48 to 1:06 PM Monday, 14 Nov 2022 in N-128B
3. "Mapping Interactions between Cationic Structure-Directing Agents and Framework Anions in Zeolites Using Computational Tools" in Microporous and Mesoporous Materials III: Structure&mdash;1:42 to 2:00 PM Monday, 14 Nov 2022 in N-128A
4. "Characterizing Rh Single-Atom Catalysts on Î³-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Using Density Functional Theory and CO Probe Molecule IR Spectroscopy" in Catalyst Design, Synthesis, and Characterization VI: Structure/activity relationships II&mdash;5:00 to 5:18 PM Tuesday, 14 Nov 2022 in N-127C

I hope to see you there!-->
